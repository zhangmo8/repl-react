# repl-react

WIP

A online playground for react, inspired by [vue/repl](https://github.com/vuejs/repl) and [unocss/playground](https://github.com/unocss/unocss/tree/main/packages/playground).

Thanks to the open source of [vue/repl](https://github.com/vuejs/repl) and its maintainers, this project is built to provide a similar experience for react.

## Features

- Code editor with syntax highlighting
- Realtime preview of react components
- Code snippet support

## How to use

1. Include the script in your HTML page
